KInspector is an application for analyzing **Kentico**. It was developed by the consulting department to automatize common tasks.

The application contains three types of modules. The **setup** modules that somehow makes easier setup of the CMS instance (e.g.: disable SMTP servers). The **analysis** modules checks for the performance and health and the **security** modules are checking for potential security issues like XSS or SQL injection throughout the system.

The KInspector is written as an independent .NET application from Kentico and could analyze **any version** of it. It supports work with the database, file system as well as with the API.
